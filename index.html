<h1>Simple Lifestyle</h1>
<p>From his childhood, Shantilal's tendency was to eat very little. Shantilal sometimes would end up eating after Diwaliba reminded him that he had still not eaten! For school, if a lunch box of puri or dhebra was prepared, he would take that; otherwise he would not worry. If any money had been given to him for eating or drinking, often it would remain unspent. Occasionally, he would use it to purchase jalebi to share with his friends as a treat. Sometimes he would use the money to buy books from Padra. In this way, Shantilal had no interest in eating or drinking. He expressed no wish of what he liked or disliked. Sometimes when Diwaliba prepared puran-poli, he would show a slight desire to eat. Otherwise 'ras-niras barobar samu' - tasty and untasty were one. Such was his nature. However, one thing was fixed in his mind - to eat only after offering thal to God. In that he never slipped up.</p>
